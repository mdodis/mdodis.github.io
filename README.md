## A little bit about me
I'm studying Computer Science (2 years at the time of writting) at the University of Crete, but I was enthusiastic about
computers for as long as I can remember now.

## A little bit *more* about me

### Initialization

My first attempt at something like "programming" (if you try really hard to see it that way), was doing AI scripting
on the Crysis map editor. I'd spend hours experimenting with different buildings, enemies. There was some down
time after that period, I didn't really touch the computer, for anything other than gaming and the Internet
that is.

## Deeper

I don't remember how I got into python scripting, but I'll attribute it to my father, since he was a major influence
(love you too mom, don't worry!). I went ahead and followed any tutorial on Youtube I could find about making
games with pygame. I ended up following [sentdex's pygame tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujOTNg17LjI).

Once I finished the tutorial, I started changing the textures to convert a racing-like game into a shmup.
I also added some (mine)music that changes between levels (the two different backdrops basically). Unfortunately
I've since lost _all_ those files. I've since learnt my lesson, and I keep multiple back-ups of any project.

At some point I remember my father showed me Blender and my mouth fell open with what it could do!
Back in the day he did modelling with LightWave 3D in his Amiga, so I guess he had an old itch to
scratch. I hastily downloaded it to my PC and started messing around with it. Besides two or three 
shortcuts, I didn't learn much though.

There was another period of nothingness, until I found out about Unity3D. Again, hastily downloaded the
engine to my computer, watched tutorials, so on. I only used C# to program on it, because (All arguments
about how C# is much better on Unity3D than anything else, but it doesn't matter now, I guess) it
was the language the tutorials used.


Unity was a staple point in my road to programming. It taught me about OOP, how engines work on a superficial
level, and many more. It wouldn't be illogical to say that, at that point, it was the most productive work
I've ever done. I also did some stuff in UE4, but I think that my Unity projects were significantly more
impressive.

But I wanted to go deeper. I know... I'm already a demon. Heaven's not my kind of place, anyway ( get the referrence?)

### Deeper!

It was time. The most notorious language in the universe. The one that will break you. The one that'll be
the end of you.

It was time for C++.

I installed Visual Studio 20... eh I don't know, the slow one. They have a messed up naming convention
anyways. The debugger is the best there ever was though. I installed it, looked up an intro series for
C++, and... I couldn't get "Hello World" to compile and run. I *literally* spent my noon trying to figure
out why. You _cannot_ imagine the joy that was brought to my eyes when it finally ran.

But, what is this? I have to go through a whole series on programming command-line programs to learn C++?
Why? Oh, because it's low-level or whatever. Worst marketing strategy. Thankfully, I wasn't willing to go
through the slow, painfull process of doing all this. I knew that I'd quit after a while.

And this is a great time to make a point out of this. Something my father taught me that I'll remember for
the rest of my life. It was about how to get into new things. I used to think that I first had to go through
all the basics to get a comprehensive grasp of the subject, and only then would I be able to enjoy doing
the part that I actually like. My father taught me to dive head first into it. Yes, at some times it may
feel like I'm hitting my head against a wall, but oh my god it works! I wouldn't have ever tried all the
things that now are part of my life, if not for that single piece of advice.

So I then looked up "How to make a game in C++" on google, and strangely, the first results included OpenGL.
I remember following about 5 or so programming tutorials on OpenGL, maybe I'll list them out if I ever
have the time. To remind you, I didn't understand a single thing about C++, not even the basics of C for that
matter. Add up referrences, classes, STL to all the cruft that comes from working with C (i.e pointers), and
it's not surprising that I was constantly frustrated when I was following the tutorials.

But I was doing what I liked, which apparently was *not* game programming, but systems and graphics. So I
persevered through all that frustration and continued hitting my head against the OpenGL and C++ wall.

I don't exactly remember when, but at some point, everything started "clicking". You know that feeling when
you realise that you can rationalize about something, like it is the only logical thing that could happen?
Well that happened. I don't know when, how or what lead me to it, but after some time, things just started
making sense. It was exhilirating. Looking back, it doesn't seem much, but at that time, it meant the *world*
to me.
