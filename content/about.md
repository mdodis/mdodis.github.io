## Yes, I have a cat

I'm a Computer Science post-graduate at the University of Crete. My main point of interest is video game development, but that's a bit generic, no? I'm more on the lower level end of things; this means:

- Game Engines
- Performance critical software
- Tools development
- VR

This isn't completely indicative of what I like to do and read about, but it encapsulates my general sphere of interests rather well, and I don't think there's a quick summary for any one person regarding their habits, hobbies or accomplishments. That's usually left up to Github for most programmers.

## What's this about?

This serves as both my personal page, as well as my blog on which I'll probably post *really* random stuff about programming. I started getting into programming from quite an early age, so there's a lot of stuff to be decompressed here, but I also like to post about my ongoing projects.
