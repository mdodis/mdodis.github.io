[This](https://mdodis.itch.io/open-solomons-key) was my first attempt at creating and publishing my very first real *game*. Obviously, it's not *my* game; it's a remake of the classic arcade game from 1986. But it was a very interesting process that's worth discussing.

## Rules
So, I started with the question: "What do I want to learn from doing this?". I'm interested in game engine development and I wanted to finally *make* something that isn't overly ambitious and would take years to complete. Let's take a look at the rules:

- No game engines or game frameworks
- Minimize the number of libraries used
- Ship for at least two platforms
- Be as close to the original as possible

The last part was pretty interesting and will be covered in more detail later in this post.

## Influences
One major influence was [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/), that I discovered randomly on YouTube; one of the very few and far between cases where the YouTube suggestion algorithm actually did produce something meaningful! The code is pretty similar to it then (if a tad too amateur-ish).

Since I wasn't even alive when this game was being played, I used the original ROM with [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/) as a reference for everything.

## Gameplay

You are Solomon, I think. The game is a blend of the various side-scrollers of the time with some interesting puzzle elements. I wouldn't say it's the hardest arcade game out there, but it was an *arcade game* so an inherent difficulty in everything was common place.

## Takeaway

I would've changed a lot of things, had I done this today
