        <h1>Open Solomon's Key</h1>

        <p>
            So, this summer I had plenty of time to mess around with stuff (eventually not accomplishing much).
            I really like the idea of making games, but I'm not the best with coming up for ideas,
            so I decided it would be best if I ported or cloned an existing game.
    
        </p>

        <p>
            Now the simplest answer would be to make a clone of say breakout, or snake or any of those games,
            but I couldn't bring myself to write _another_ clone of those games.
            Consulting my father proved to be a wise choice.
            He'd (relatively) recently made a faithful port of Solomon's Key (1986, tecmo) in Game Maker Studio 2.
        
        </p>

            This is a hybrid article / sub-blog, because the project is still under heavy development 
            (mainly because it's a side-project, or just because I'm an amateur).

        </p>
        
        <h2>The Game</h2>
        <p>
            Obviously, I wasn't around when it was released, but thanks to his port
            (which you can find <a href="https://immortalx74.itch.io/solomonskeyremake">here</a>),
            I had a chance to <i>play</i> the game.
        
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe the fact that it's another arcade game might elude to you thinking that it's another "sidescroller"
            where the character is a stereotypical army man shooting bad guys with big guns (don't get me wrong;
            I like those types of games too, but there are <i>way</i> too many of those games).
            That kind of assumption is criminally wrong.
            The game has a lot of depth and complexity when one takes into account the hardware limitations at the time compared to nowadays.
        
        </p>
        
        <!-- Picture here -->
        
        <p>
            I was enthralled by it. So I set out to make a port (or clone, whatever terminology suits best),
            but in order to differentiate my version, from the already existing one,
            I thought it would be a cool idea, if the game was available on linux along with Windows, using a small platform layer,
            as well as featuring a level format.
        
        </p>
        
        <h2>Foundation</h2>
        <p>
            As you can probably guess I had to make some decisions about the platform layer,
            and the helper libraries that would be used to bootstrap the project.
            I settled on very few (glm and stb_image), and decided it would make for an interesting grind;
            to finally have to deal with two distinct layers, namely X11 and Win32.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thankfully, I was very fortunate to have seen some of Casey Muratori's videos on platform layers,
            especially when it came to the Win32 platform code. But at the time,
            my (Windows) desktop wasn't available to me, and my laptop had Linux installed.
            Guess we'll start with Xlib!
        
        </p>
        
        <h3>Starting on Linux</h3> 
        <p>
            I've made it my objective to refrain from posting too much code,
            especially code that you can find easily online,
            so I won't be posting the Xlib example window code. Let's get on with it then!

        <p>
            A quick search yielded plenty results for creating an immediate-mode OpenGL compatible window on Xlib (although considerably less than Win32).
            The code was pretty straight forward, and I had a window up and running in no time.
            I'd decided before-hand that I'd use immediate-mode OpenGL,
            until I was unable to, so I was quite happy to have some boilerplate stuff up and running.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Since the game is based on tilemaps, the engine would be tilemap oriented (even text is supported only through tilemaps);
            so all I needed to do was:

            <ol>
                <li>Figure out how to do tilemaps in OpenGL</li>
                <li>Prosper</li>
            </ol>

            Unfortunately, things don't always work out this way (hint hint)...
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The main culprit was filtering.
            Textures would have seams between them when the viewport's width and height components weren't powers of 2.
            I <i>could</i> have just ignored that, and in retrospect, I should have,
            but I've proven to be a stickler (unfortunately) for these kinds of things.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            Another problem was the aspect ratio.
            I <i>really</i> wanted to support windows of any sizes, but
            at the same time I wanted the aspect ratio to never change.
            I'll talk about the latter of these two problems, since it was an easier fix.

        </p>
        
        <h2>Retained Aspect Ratio</h2> 
        <p>
            So, the game has a viewport of dimensions 1024 by 896.
            Each tile has a size of 64 pixels, and each level's tilemap is 15x12 tiles.
            But, that means that the viewport width should be 15 * 64 = 960!
            It would, if it weren't for a 32 pixel padding on the left right portions of the screen,
            as well as a 64 pixel padding on the top and bottom.
            So, if you were to count actual tiles, the viewport size (in tile units) would be 16x14.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Anyway, that's easily solved when we finish with retaining the aspect ratio,
            which is 0.875, such a pleasing number for some reason. Now, when we resize we do the following:

        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Get the new window dimensions</li>
            <li>
                Truncate the viewport size depending on which of the two dimensions is greater
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If width > height:
                        <ul>
                            <li>width = new_height * width_over_height_ratio</li>
                            <li>height = new_height</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If width <= height:
                        <ul>                        
                            <li>height = new_width * height_over_width_ratio</li>
                            <li>width = new_width</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>

                    <li>Get the leftover space from the changed dimension</li>
                    <li>Move the viewport towards half its length (to center it)</li>
                    <li>Get the current tile-scale (width * (tile_size/original_view_size))</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            I left out a special case where the leftover portion gets negative,
            because math, but you will be able to see that whenever I release the source code.
            The tile scale is used to determine what the relative size of the tiles depending on the window size is supposed to be.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Obviously, we won't make the game code be tile-scale dependent, since the
            tile scale only changes the rendering component.
            So, we're basically doing the game code in 1024x896 resolution, and scaling that according
            to the user controlled window size.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And like that, we're done with window sizes!
            I quickly got a png with some random sprites from the game,
            loaded it with stb_image, and set out to figure out tilemaps (for the first time).

        </p>
        
        <h3>OpenGL and Tilemaps</h3> 
        <p>
            As you know, I decided to use old school OpenGL until the moment it starts giving me trouble, and to my dismay that moment came very soon.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            When loading a texture(or a tilemap) with OpenGL,
            you can set options to adjust the filtering, mip-maps, etc.
            This is a low res game, so nearest neighbor filtering was my obvious choice.
            But, texture coordinates are normalized, so I didn't have a way to specify exact pixels;
            and beacause of the way OpenGL can sample textures( read texels vs pixels),
            I would have seams, everywhere, because of the weird tile scale.

        </p>

        <p>
            There is an easy fix for this though, and that's enforcing the viewport size dimensions to be a power of 2,
            and that's what the ominous option: "OSK_ROUND_TO_POW_2" means. But I didn't like that solution (as I told you, a stickler).

        </p>
        
        <p>
            There is one widely used solution, and a cleaner one (in my humble opinion) that I eventually used.

        </p>

        <p>
            The gist is, surround each of your tiles in the tilemap texture with an extended border,
            1px or more, depending on how big you're planning to scale it to.
            I don't like this solution;
            It's hacky, it forces you to either add the borders manually, or even worse,
            have a build script that will have to pre-process all the art assets.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            So of course I did not go down that path.
            Instead I opted out to switch to modern(-ish) OpenGL and use the Array Texture.
            I still haven't figured out if that decision was wise.
