            When you make an application, you mostly care about functionality, no matter what, right?
            So what happens then? Specifically, what happens when the application you want to create is 
            supposed to work on more than one platform?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well your programmer mind will most likely go on to have you use cross-platform libraries
