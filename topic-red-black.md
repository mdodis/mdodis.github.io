### Red Black
The other engine on which I had some success is Construct 2, even though I completely disagreed, with some
decisions as to how the engine works. But it was a big trend at the time; still is actually! The web.

I don't know how all this craze with doing everything on the web started, but I guess people realised that browsers run
everywhere, so let's just use *them* as a VM for our applications! Not an idea that I agree with. Some things should stay
native, and web-pages should be simple. Look at any modern "web-app" and convince yourself that it runs well. You can't,
unless you've never seen a well written native one. But I think no matter what, you can all agree that taking up as much space
as the window manager of the OS is unacceptable.

Anyways, let me try to stay relevant to the post, maybe I'll rant about the web at some other time.

#### The Idea
You are a girl in a post-nuclear world. You have a wrench as your only means of a defense. Not even a wrench could help you overpower the monstrous creations of this apocalyptic habitat, though. You'll have to switch between sneaking, running and engaging constantly in order to survive through each level.
