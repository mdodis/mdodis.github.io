            Hello! My name is Michael Dodis, and this is a short page for me to showcase all my projects!
            And to talk about my experience with computers. Sorry for being down for so long!
        </p>
        <p>
            Edit: This may serve a dual purpose as a blog. I'll be looking through some other projects (either
            unfinished or abandoned and I'll post them here over time).

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm studying Computer Science (2 years at the time of writing) at the University of Crete, but I was
            enthusiastic about
            computers for as long as I can remember now.
        </p>

        <h2> A little bit <i> more</i> about me</h2>
        <p>
            My first attempt at something like "programming" (if you try really hard to see it that way), was doing AI
            scripting
            on the Crysis map editor. I'd spend hours experimenting with different buildings, enemies. There was some
            down
            time after that period, I didn't really touch the computer, for anything other than gaming and the Internet
            that is.
        </p>

        <h3>Deeper</h3>
        <p>
            I don't remember how I got into python scripting, but I'll attribute it to my father, since he was a major
            influence
            (love you too mom, don't worry!). I went ahead and followed any tutorial on Youtube I could find about
            making
            games with pygame. I ended up following
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujOTNg17LjI">sentdex's pygame
                tutorial</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once I finished the tutorial, I started changing the textures to convert a racing-like game into a shmup.
            I also added some (mine)music that changes between levels (the two different backdrops basically).
            Unfortunately
            I've since lost <i>all</i> those files. I've since learnt my lesson, and I keep multiple back-ups of any
            project.

        </p>

        <p>
            At some point I remember my father showed me Blender and my mouth fell open with what it could do!
            Back in the day he did modelling with LightWave 3D in his Amiga, so I guess he had an old itch to
            scratch. I hastily downloaded it to my PC and started messing around with it. Besides two or three
            shortcuts, I didn't learn much though.

        </p>

        <p>
            There was another period of nothingness, until I found out about Unity3D. Again, hastily downloaded the
            engine to my computer, watched tutorials, so on. I only used C# to program on it, because (All arguments
            about how C# is much better on Unity3D than anything else, but it doesn't matter now, I guess) it
            was the language the tutorials used.

        </p>

        <p>
            Unity was a staple point in my road to programming. It taught me about OOP, how engines work on a
            superficial
            level, and many more. It wouldn't be illogical to say that, at that point, it was the most productive work
            I've ever done. I also did some stuff in UE4, but I think that my Unity projects were significantly more
            impressive.
        </p>

        <h3>Deeper!</h3>

        <p>
            It was time. The most notorious language in the universe. The one that will break you. The one that'll be
            the end of you.

            It was time for C++.

        </p>

        <p>
            I installed Visual Studio 20... eh I don't know, the slow one. They have a messed up naming convention
            anyways. The debugger is the best there ever was though. I installed it, looked up an intro series for
            C++, and... I couldn't get "Hello World" to compile and run. I <i>literally</i> spent my noon trying to
            figure
            out why. You _cannot_ imagine the joy that was brought to my eyes when it finally ran.

        </p>

        <p>
            But, what is this? I have to go through a whole series on programming command-line programs to learn C++?
            Why? Oh, because it's low-level or whatever. Worst marketing strategy. Thankfully, I wasn't willing to go
            through the slow, painful process of doing all this. I knew that I'd quit after a while.

        </p>

        <p>
            And this is a great time to make a point out of this. Something my father taught me that I'll remember for
            the rest of my life. It was about how to get into new things. I used to think that I first had to go through
            all the basics to get a comprehensive grasp of the subject, and only then would I be able to enjoy doing
            the part that I actually like. My father taught me to dive head first into it. Yes, at some times it may
            feel like I'm hitting my head against a wall, but oh my god it works! I wouldn't have ever tried all the
            things that now are part of my life, if not for that single piece of advice.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I then looked up "How to make a game in C++" on google, and strangely, the first results included OpenGL.
            I remember following about 5 or so programming tutorials on OpenGL, maybe I'll list them out if I ever
            have the time. To remind you, I didn't understand a single thing about C++, not even the basics of C for
            that
            matter. Add up references, classes, STL to all the cruft that comes from working with C (i.e pointers), and
            it's not surprising that I was constantly frustrated when I was following the tutorials.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I was doing what I liked, which apparently was <i>not</i> game programming, but systems and graphics. So I
            persevered through all that frustration and continued hitting my head against the OpenGL and C++ wall.

        </p>

        <p>
            I don't exactly remember when, but at some point, everything started "clicking". You know that feeling when
            you realise that you can rationalize about something, like it is the only logical thing that could happen?
            Well that happened. I don't know when, how or what lead me to it, but after some time, things just started
            making sense. It was exhilarating. Looking back, it doesn't seem much, but at that time, it meant the
            <i>world</i>
            to me.

        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, this is not the whole story, I had run-ins with many different development tools; besides
            Unity, there was also Construct 2. Construct 2 has a special place in my lifetime; So I'll be posting
            about it from time to time.

        </p>

        <p>
            After some time, working with C++ and OpenGL, attempting to create a "Game Engine" (if you could even say
            that),
            I messed around with several other stuff. Not just in C++! There was also [love](#love).

        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I'm working on several stuff, whenever I have the time, so expect more posts on... eh, I don't know,
            whenever I
            feel like I need to say something significant. Blog entries will be more specific on topics in terms of my
            experiences, so
            watch out for them! I mean, if you want to; I don't know why I even started writing this page. I'd delete
            it, but...
            It took some time to write all of those words, so I guess I'll keep it.
