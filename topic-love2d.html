    <h1>On Love2d</h1>

    <div class="Post">

        <p>
            <a href="https://love2d.org/"> Love2d</a> was special to me. I may have quit using it (although I do peruse
            the
            documentation
            from time to time), but it'll always have a special place in my heart. Why, you ask?
        </p>

        <p>

            Because it's simple and powerful. Lua is a great scripting language (apart from counting from 1. Why!?);
            It's simple
            to develop on. Just grab the executable, install it, and write code in main! The language doesn't even
            support OOP by
            default, but you can implement it yourself with meta-programming. Don't get me wrong; Game engines like Game
            Maker Studio 2
            Construct 2, Unity's 2D support (etc.), and especially Game Maker are the norm in 2D indie games, and for
            good reason! They all
            have a lot of material and tutorials all over the internet.

        </p>

        <p>
            But, one major grudge that I have with those Engines, is that they <i> really</i> want to do the project
            management for you.
            Meaning, how they'll process your art packages, and sometimes even your code structure (looking at you, Game
            Maker). Of the ones
            that I have used, Game Maker probably does the work job. It's entitled to it though, since they need to
            support older versions
            of the engine. But the problem is there. Your code goes all over the place with varying *types* of code:
            initialization code,
            scene code and more.

        </p>

        <p>
            But, this is from the perspective of someone who prefers to do those things himself. Love2d is excellent for
            that, just run it
            and it'll basically have 3 callback functions: init, update and draw. You don't need more than that! If
            you're interested,
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jte9o4S6rlo">recursor</a> has an excellent tutorial series. Beware though,
            there were some changes
            to how the colors work (they are now normalized RGBA).
