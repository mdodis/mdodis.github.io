            The other engine on which I had some success is Construct 2, even though I completely disagreed, with some
            decisions as to how the engine works. But it was a big trend at the time; still is actually! The web.

        </p>

        <p>
            I don't know how all this craze with doing everything on the web started, but I guess people realised that
            browsers run
            everywhere, so let's just use *them* as a VM for our applications! Not an idea that I agree with. Some
            things should stay
            native, and web-pages should be simple. Look at any modern "web-app" and convince yourself that it runs
            well. You can't,
            unless you've never seen a well written native one. But I think no matter what, you can all agree that
            taking up as much space
            as the window manager of the OS is unacceptable.

        </p>

        <p>Anyways, let me try to stay relevant to the post, maybe I'll rant about the web at some other time.</p>


        <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <p>
            You are a girl in a post-nuclear world. You have a wrench as your only means of defense. Not even a wrench
            could help you overpower the monstrous creations of this apocalyptic habitat, though. You'll have to switch
            between sneaking, running and engaging constantly in order to survive through each level.

        </p>

        <h2>Some Notes on Construct 2</h2>
        <p>
            This is the first game engine I ever used, and for the most part it was great! Easy drag and drop, probably
            the best scripting system I've ever seen (Event - Action style)...
            But it's web based *only*. Even if you export it as an executable, you have to use nwjs, which is
            quintessentially a stripped-down version of chrome.
            That means that you get to inherit all the weirdness of storing files on disk (foreshadowing).

        </p>

        <p>
            The idea, isn't particuraly unique; the post-apocalyptic setting in the general sense is a very common one,
            and for good reason! No matter what,
            whether anyone believes that the utilization of nuclear energy is primarily beneficial,
            or that we're in over our heads meddling with the precise nature of atoms; we will all be wandering about
            how the world would have been,
            if something went _really_ wrong, until the end of us.

            The process was certainly interesting. This was my first (ever!) collaborative work with my father. I was
            designated
            to the programming counterpart and he would handle textures and animation. I can tell you right now, that
            the animations for the girl character looked absolutely amazing!
            It was really energizing to see them early, instead of a collision rectangle or a last-minute painted
            stickman figure.
            It wasn't hand-painted or anything; instead it was a series of images from the internet recolored with
            smooth gradients, and then animated with a 2d skeleton.
            My father's profficiency with image manipulation had paid off very early.

            The basic movement controls were very easy. Couple that with the great built-in collision system and I had a platform character in no-time.
            Construct was really good with that; just add the platformer behavior and you're done.
            No manual collision detection/response (looking at you Game Maker), and it's functional at the very least.

            Surprisingly, the most tedious part was saving and loading controls, and this was the part I shouldn't have focused on.
            It's this weird chore you have to go through, mainly because... you guessed it! Browser only.
