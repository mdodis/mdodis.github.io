        <p>
            This is my first project with love2d, and most notably the only one that actually got anywhere, to be
            honest.

        </p>

        <p>

            In case the GIF isn't visible (quite possible I'm afraid; I don't know how to make proper gifs), there is
            a little player sprite, that collides with the box indicated by a red outline. It looks like it's
            pixel-perfect
            because of the collision model.

        </p>

        <p>
            I don't remember exactly when I started building this "Engine", but I do know why; My friends and I were
            thinking about making a small 2D side-scroll game during some vacation. Of course, as you can tell I was
            more enthusiastic about building the engine rather than the actual game, but at the very least it got me
            working on something. This is going to be a code review of sorts, where I'll go over some interesting things
            I
            discovered during this endeavor, maybe someone out there will appreciate it!

        </p>


        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            At that time, I was heavily utilizing OOP, to a degree that you could call: too extensive. I've since moved
            away from this type of programming, since it gets me into bad habits; mainly trying to "design" rather than
            do anything meaningful.

        </p>

        <p>
            Since I wanted some king of object-orientation and Lua by default doesn't support it (absolutely solid
            choice of
            a programming language on my part!), I started looking through tutorials. Fortunately, lua has a very
            powerful
            meta-programming model, and various implementations of class-like structures were plenty. So I chose the
            simplest one and went on creating base classes like:

        </p>

        <pre><code class="lua" >
local class = require("util.class")
local Vector2 = class:derive("Vector2")

function Vector2:new(x, y)
    self.x = x or 0
    self.y = y or 0
end
        </code></pre>

        <p>along with a Box class</p>

        <pre><code>
local Tools = require("util.Tools")
local class = require("util.class")
local Box = class:derive("Box")
local Vector2 = require("maths.Vector2")

function Box:new(x, y, w, h)
    self.w = w or 8
    self.h = h or 8
    self.x = x - w/2
    self.y = y - h/2
end

function Box:Draw()
    -- love.graphics.setColor(1,0,0,1)
    love.graphics.rectangle('line', self.x, self.y, self.w, self.h)
    -- love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 1, 1)
end
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            Of course, this is not in chronological order! I ended up adding functionality to all
            those base classes, when needed.

        </p>

        <h2>Events</h2>

        <p>
            I was initially talking about the very basic collision handling, but I had completely
            forgotten that I'd written so much code! The recursor tutorial that I referenced in the
            <a href="/topic-love2d.html">love2d</a> article actually included an event system for keyboard and gamepad handling!

        </p>

        <p>
            I won't talk much about it here though, since it's mainly code that I just followed along with.

        </p>

        <h2>Scenes</h2>
        <p>
            Now this is a big ol' chunk of code! Before even implementing basic movement or combat, or anything along
            the lines of an _actual_ game, I was wise and went on to scene management. I now see how this could have
            lead to this project being canned. Maybe I'll redo it at some point, with less useless code, hopefully.

        </p>

        <p>
            My idea of a scene was a pair of files, one having all the data needed for the scene to be run; audio,
            images,
            and the other one containing the <i>actual</i> code. Of course generic code like player movement would not be
            included.

        </p>

        <p>
            This was the major time-sink of the project. I tried using JSON files to specify the scene objects, spending
            all my precious "get excited" time to accomplish close to nothing. I also wanted to make a level-editor.
            Sigh.

        </p>

        <h2>Collision</h2>


        <p>
            For collision, I used
            [Minkowski Difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition),
            to move the object <i>back</i> if it has collided. If you've used Game Maker, this
            probably sounds backwards to you (I usually see people calculating the next position
            and then choosing to move by smaller increments).


            Here's the code that goes along with that:

        </p>

        <pre><code class="lua">
function Box:MinowskiDiff(b)
    assert(b:Is(Box), "Box:MinowskiDiff - Expected Box!")
    local top_left = Vector2.Sub(self:UpLeft(), b:DownRight())
    local newSize = Vector2.Add(self:Size(), b:Size())
    local newLeft = Vector2.Add(top_left, newSize:Div(2))
    return Box.CreateCentered(newLeft.x, newLeft.y, newSize.x, newSize.y)
end

function Box:ClosestPointOnBounds(point)
    assert(point:Is(Vector2),"Box:ClosestPointOnBounds - Expected point to be a vector2!")
    local minDist = math.abs(point.x - self.x)
    local max = self:DownRight()
    local bPoint = Vector2(self.x, point.y)

    if math.abs(max.x - point.x) < minDist then
        minDist = math.abs(max.x - point.x)
        bPoint = Vector2(max.x, point.y)
    end

    if math.abs(max.y - point.y) < minDist then
        minDist = math.abs(max.y - point.y)
        bPoint = Vector2(point.x, max.y)
    end

    if math.abs(self.y - point.y) < minDist then
        minDist = math.abs(self.y - point.y)
        bPoint = Vector2(point.x, self.y)
    end
    return bPoint
end

function Box.CreateCentered(x, y, w, h)
    local b = Box(0,0,w,h)
    b:SetCenter(x,y)
    return b
end 
        </code></pre>


        <p>
            Then I just do an AABB collision test, and if it hits I move the player character
            back.

        </p>

        <h2> Last but not the least stupid</h2>
        <p>
            Of course, you can't have a game engine by an amateur (still am!) without premature optimization. So I
            looked up
            how to use sprite batches, and included that as well. Bravo Michael.

        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Some wise guy said failing is another step to achieving success, I think. Probably forged that from my mind,
            so
            don't try to read into it. I think that failing in my case had a certain requirement in order to become
            effective.
            That was, failing to do <i>the important stuff</i>. I was desperately trying to work out Scene Management, event
            systems
            and all this pointless stuff; again they're probably very important, but not at the initial stage of
            development.

        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe it wouldn't matter if I just started writing the actual game code; but I'd have learnt a lot more
            about it, as
            well as be more excited when I revisited it today. This was my major pattern with writing engines; I'd focus
            too much
            on unimportant stuff, rather that writing the code that I needed at that point in time.

        </p>

        <p>
            Failing and trying again is good, don't give up. But it's important to understand that failing at something
            and
            doing the exact same thing again, expecting to somehow get further, is probably not a good idea. It took me
            a lot of time
            to realise this.


            Thank you for reading this reaaally long post!
